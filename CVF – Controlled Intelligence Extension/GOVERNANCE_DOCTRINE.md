# CVF Governance Doctrine

## I. Supremacy Rule

Governance overrides:
- Role decisions
- Reasoning output
- Learning injection
- Telemetry-based suggestions

No exception.

---

## II. Non-Autonomy Rule

CVF shall not:
- Self-modify rules automatically
- Override policy based on performance
- Introduce new roles without governance approval
- Activate new lessons without validation

---

## III. Deterministic Priority Rule

Default reasoning mode = STRICT.

Creative reasoning must be explicitly permitted.

---

## IV. Learning Constraint Rule

Lessons:
- Must be versioned
- Must pass conflict detection
- Must not silently override policy

---

## V. Auditability Rule

All governance events must be logged.

Snapshots must allow reproducibility.

---

## VI. Version Escalation Rule

Major version (2.0) requires:
- Core governance redesign
- Architectural topology change

CVF 1.7.0 is an extension, not a redesign.
