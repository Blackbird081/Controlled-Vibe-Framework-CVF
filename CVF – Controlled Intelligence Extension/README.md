# Controlled Vibe Framework (CVF)

## Version 1.7.0 – Controlled Intelligence Extension

CVF is a governance-first intelligence architecture.

It is NOT:
- A multi-agent mesh
- A self-modifying autonomous system
- A stochastic experimentation engine

It IS:
- A Single-Agent Multi-Role system
- Deterministic-first
- Governance-enforced
- Audit-ready
- Version-controlled learning architecture

## Core Principles

### 1. Governance Above Intelligence
No reasoning step can override governance rules.

### 2. Single Agent – Multi Role
CVF prefers internal role transition over multiple agents with divergent logic.

### 3. Determinism Over Randomness
Temperature is controlled.
Entropy is monitored.
Snapshots enable reproducibility.

### 4. Learning Without Mutation
Lessons are:
- Versioned
- Conflict-checked
- Injected, not auto-applied

### 5. Measured Intelligence
CVF tracks:
- Mistake rate
- Elegance score
- Verification score
- Governance events

## Architectural Layers

1. Core (Governance, Risk, Rollback)
2. Intelligence (Controlled reasoning)
3. Learning (Versioned memory)
4. Telemetry (Measured performance)

## Design Philosophy

Quality > Quantity  
Control > Autonomy  
Structure > Chaos  
Determinism > Drift  
Governance > Intelligence
