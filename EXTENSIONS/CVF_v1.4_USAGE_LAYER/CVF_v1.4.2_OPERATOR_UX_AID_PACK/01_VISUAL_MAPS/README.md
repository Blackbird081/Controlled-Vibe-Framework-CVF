# VISUAL MAPS – USAGE GUIDE

> Visual Maps exist to **compress understanding**, not to guide execution.

---

## 1. Purpose of Visual Maps

The visual maps in this folder provide **structural clarity** of CVF behavior.

They are designed to help operators:

* see boundaries at a glance,
* understand decision paths without reading every rule,
* avoid misuse caused by mental overload.

Visual maps are **explanatory artifacts**, not operational tools.

---

## 2. What Visual Maps Are

Visual maps ARE:

* read-only representations of CVF logic
* simplified views of complex rule sets
* aids for onboarding and review

They help answer questions like:

* "Where am I in the CVF lifecycle?"
* "Who is responsible at this point?"
* "What happens if I continue vs stop?"

---

## 3. What Visual Maps Are NOT

Visual maps are NOT:

* workflows
* execution plans
* decision engines
* step-by-step instructions

They must never be treated as:

* permission to act
* authorization to bypass rules
* substitutes for CVF core documents

---

## 4. How to Use Visual Maps Correctly

Recommended usage:

1. **Before execution**

   * review lifecycle and boundary maps
   * confirm operator role

2. **After execution**

   * classify outcome
   * decide stop / rerun / escalate

Visual maps must never be consulted mid-run.

---

## 5. Scope Limitation

Visual maps:

* do not cover every edge case
* intentionally omit low-level detail

When in doubt:

* defer to CVF core text
* not to visual interpretation

---

## 6. Integrity Rule

If a visual map conflicts with:

* CVF v1.3.1 core
* CVF v1.4.1 operator rules

The map is considered **incorrect** and must be updated.

Maps have no authority on their own.

---

## 7. File Overview

This folder contains:

* CVF lifecycle overview
* responsibility boundary mapping
* misuse-to-escalation flow
* stop / rerun / accept decision tree

Each map addresses a single cognitive burden.

## 8. Final Reminder

> Visual clarity reduces mistakes.
>
> It does not justify them.

Always treat maps as **orientation tools**, never as execution guidance.
