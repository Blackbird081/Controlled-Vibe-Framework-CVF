> **Prerequisite**: CVF v1.4 (Core) + optional v1.4.1

## 1. What v1.4.2 Is

CVF v1.4.2 is an **Operator UX & Structural Aid Pack**.

Its sole purpose is to:

* reduce operator cognitive load,
* make CVF easier to understand and apply correctly,
* **without modifying execution behavior or responsibility rules**.

v1.4.2 does **not**:

* change how AI executes,
* improve output quality,
* introduce workflows, nodes, or interaction loops.

If CVF core defines *discipline*, v1.4.2 provides *clarity*.

---

## 2. What v1.4.2 Is NOT

To avoid misuse, v1.4.2 explicitly rejects the following interpretations:

* ❌ A workflow engine
* ❌ A visual AI builder
* ❌ A prompt optimization toolkit
* ❌ A debugging or troubleshooting guide
* ❌ A replacement for CVF core

Any use of v1.4.2 to:

* influence execution mid‑run,
* fix output after the fact,
* bypass CVF boundaries

is considered **invalid by design**.

---

## 3. Design Principles

v1.4.2 follows four non‑negotiable principles:

1. **Read‑only assistance**

   * Visuals and templates explain; they do not execute.

2. **Operator accountability preserved**

   * Every decision remains with the operator.

3. **No silent automation**

   * Suggestions require explicit operator approval.

4. **Detachable layer**

   * CVF remains fully valid if v1.4.2 is removed.

## 4. Package Structure Overview

This pack is organized into five functional areas:

1. **Visual Maps** – Understand CVF flow at a glance
2. **Phase Block Templates** – Fill‑in structures, not executable nodes
3. **Intent → Input Helper** – Pre‑execution clarification only
4. **Operator UX Guardrails** – Prevent common misuse behaviors
5. **Integration References** – Safe linkage to other CVF versions

Each folder is self‑contained and can be adopted independently.

---

## 5. How to Use v1.4.2 Correctly

Recommended usage order:

1. Review **01_VISUAL_MAPS** to internalize CVF boundaries
2. Use **02_PHASE_BLOCK_TEMPLATES** to prepare execution inputs
3. (Optional) Apply **03_INTENT_TO_INPUT_HELPER** for clarity
4. Run **04_OPERATOR_UX_GUARDRAILS** before execution
5. Execute strictly under CVF v1.3.1 rules

At no point should v1.4.2 be consulted *during* execution.

---

## 6. Compatibility & Versioning

* Fully compatible with:

  * CVF v1.3.1 (Core)
  * CVF v1.4.1 (Operator Extension Pack)

* Introduces:

  * No breaking changes
  * No new permissions
  * No enforcement logic

Version numbering rationale:

* **v1.4.2** reflects a structural UX expansion
* Core CVF remains anchored at v1.3.x

---

## 7. Responsibility Reminder

> v1.4.2 exists to make mistakes *less likely*, not *less costly*.

All outcomes produced under CVF remain the responsibility of the operator.

If something fails:

* accept the failure,
* review the input,
* re‑execute if appropriate.

Do not attempt to repair outputs using this pack.

---

## 8. Final Statement

CVF v1.4.2 helps operators **see the system clearly**.

It does not think, decide, or act on their behalf.

Clarity is provided.
Responsibility remains.
