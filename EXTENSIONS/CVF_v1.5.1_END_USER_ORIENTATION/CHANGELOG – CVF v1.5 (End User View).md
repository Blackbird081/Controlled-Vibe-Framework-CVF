# CHANGELOG – CVF v1.5 (End User View)

## Version: v1.5

**Status:** Stable – Ready to Freeze

### Added

* End User–centric documentation set, independent from Operator Edition
* Clear expectation management: what CVF *is* and *is not*
* Practical guidance on how end users should interact with CVF without touching execution
* Common misuse & failure mode taxonomy focused on human behavior
* Two practical mini cases demonstrating correct vs incorrect usage
* Management-facing presentation guide (non-technical, risk-focused)
* Readiness & adoption checklist for safe rollout

### Changed

* Shifted narrative from "how to control AI" → "how humans should work with a controlled system"
* Removed all implicit assumptions that end users need AI or prompt knowledge
* Reframed CVF as a governance and responsibility framework, not an AI capability booster

### Not Included (By Design)

* Prompt engineering guides
* Model/tool recommendations
* Performance or accuracy benchmarks
* Technical enforcement or CI/CD details

### Rationale

v1.5 exists to **reduce misuse, confusion, and over-expectation** from end users, which were identified as the primary failure causes in earlier versions.
