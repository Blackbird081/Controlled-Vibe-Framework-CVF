## CVF v1.5 – End User View (Current)

## Relationship Between Versions

* v1.3.x = The Constitution
* v1.4.x = The Operating Manual
* v1.5 = The User Guide

Each version serves a **different role**. They are complementary, not sequential requirements for the same reader.

## Freeze Recommendation

With v1.5 complete, CVF now covers:

* System design (v1.3)
* System operation (v1.4)
* System usage (v1.5)

No further changes are required before freeze unless scope expands beyond end-user education.
