## 🔍 Cách đánh giá

**Checklist Accept/Reject:**

- [ ] Covers OWASP Top 10
- [ ] Risk levels appropriate
- [ ] Remediation actionable
- [ ] Considers compliance
- [ ] Prioritized findings
- [ ] No false sense of security

**Red flags (cần Reject):**
- ⚠️ Missing critical areas
- ⚠️ Vague remediations
- ⚠️ Underestimated risks
- ⚠️ Ignores compliance requirements

---

## ⚠️ Common Failures

| Lỗi thường gặp | Cách phòng tránh |
|----------------|------------------|
| Surface-level review | Provide detailed tech stack |
| Missing auth issues | Explicitly describe auth flow |
| Generic OWASP list | Ask for specific to your stack |
| Ignores compliance | State regulations upfront |

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Describe auth flow** — Most vulns here
2. **List all data types** — Especially PII
3. **Include infrastructure** — Cloud config matters
4. **State compliance needs** — GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
5. **Share current measures** — Avoid redundant findings

---

## 📊 Ví dụ thực tế

### Input mẫu:
```
System: Healthcare appointment booking app
Tech stack: React, Node.js Express, MongoDB, AWS
Data handled: Patient PII, health records, appointment history
Current measures: HTTPS, JWT tokens, bcrypt passwords
Compliance: HIPAA required
Threat model: Concerned about data breaches, unauthorized access
```

### Output mẫu:
```
SECURITY AUDIT: Healthcare Booking App

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall Posture: MEDIUM RISK
Critical Findings: 3
High Findings: 4

Top Risks:
• Health records not encrypted at rest
• No audit logging for data access
• JWT tokens don't expire

2. SCOPE
   - Application security review
   - HIPAA compliance check
   - Limitations: No penetration testing

3. FINDINGS

   AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🔴 CRITICAL: JWT tokens never expire
      Risk: Stolen tokens valid forever
      HIPAA: §164.312(d) - Session management
      Fix: Implement 15-min access + refresh tokens
   
   🟠 HIGH: No MFA for healthcare data access
      Risk: Single factor compromise
      HIPAA: Recommended under §164.312(d)
      Fix: Require MFA for providers/admin
   
   DATA PROTECTION
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🔴 CRITICAL: Health records not encrypted at rest
      Risk: Data breach exposes PHI
      HIPAA: §164.312(a)(2)(iv) - Encryption
      Fix: Enable MongoDB encryption, AWS KMS
   
   🔴 CRITICAL: No field-level encryption for SSN
      Risk: DB compromise = full exposure
      Fix: Client-side encryption for sensitive fields
   
   🟠 HIGH: Backups not encrypted
      Risk: Backup theft = data breach
      Fix: Enable AWS backup encryption
   
   ACCESS LOGGING
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🟠 HIGH: No audit trail for PHI access
      Risk: Can't detect/investigate breaches
      HIPAA: §164.312(b) - Audit controls
      Fix: Implement comprehensive audit logging
   
   API SECURITY
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🟡 MEDIUM: No rate limiting
      Risk: Brute force attacks
      Fix: Implement rate limiting (100 req/min)
   
   🟡 MEDIUM: Verbose error messages
      Risk: Information disclosure
      Fix: Generic errors in production

4. HIPAA COMPLIANCE GAPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ❌ §164.312(a) - Access Control
      - Missing: Role-based access audit
   
   ❌ §164.312(b) - Audit Controls
      - Missing: PHI access logging
   
   ❌ §164.312(e) - Transmission Security
      - OK: HTTPS in place ✓
   
   ❌ §164.312(a)(2)(iv) - Encryption
      - Missing: At-rest encryption

5. RISK SUMMARY
   | Finding | Risk | Priority |
   |---------|------|----------|
   | No encryption at rest | Critical | P0 |
   | JWT no expiry | Critical | P0 |
   | No audit logging | High | P1 |
   | No MFA | High | P1 |

6. REMEDIATION ROADMAP

   IMMEDIATE (Week 1):
   • Implement JWT expiry (access: 15min, refresh: 7d)
   • Enable MongoDB encryption
   
   SHORT-TERM (Month 1):
   • Implement audit logging
   • Add MFA for providers
   • Field-level encryption for SSN
   
   LONG-TERM (Quarter 1):
   • Full HIPAA compliance review
   • Security training for team
   • Penetration testing
```

### Đánh giá:
- ✅ Covers authentication, data, logging, API
- ✅ HIPAA gaps clearly mapped
- ✅ Risk levels appropriate
- ✅ Remediation với timeline
- ✅ Prioritized by severity
- **Kết quả: ACCEPT**
