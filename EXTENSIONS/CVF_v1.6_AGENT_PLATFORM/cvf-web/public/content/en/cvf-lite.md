## Why the Change?

We consolidated multiple entry points (START_HERE, CVF_LITE, QUICK_START) into one comprehensive guide at docs/GET_STARTED.md.

**Before:** 3+ entry points → confusing, overlapping  
**Now:** 1 entry point → clear and focused

This reduces confusion and enables faster onboarding.

## Step 4: Copy & Paste into AI (2 min)

1. Copy the `Form Input` section from the skill file
2. Fill in your information in the fields
3. Paste into AI (Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
4. Check the output against `Expected Output`

**Quick example:**

```
I need a code review for file auth.py:
- Language: Python
- Focus: Security + Performance
- Risk Level: R2 (needs human review)
- Expected: List of issues with severity
```

## Step 5: Check Results (1 min)

Use the checklist from `Evaluation Checklist` in the skill file:

- [ ] Is the output in the expected format?
- [ ] No fabricated information (hallucination)?
- [ ] Within declared scope?
- [ ] Appropriate risk level?

**Done.** You just used CVF for the first time. 🎉

## Quick FAQ

**Q: Is governance (.gov.md) mandatory?**  
A: No. For individuals, you only need `.skill.md`. Governance is for teams that want to track quality.

**Q: Can I create new skills?**  
A: Yes. Copy a skill file → edit the content → done. See v1.1/templates/ for templates.

**Q: Does CVF lock me into a specific AI tool?**  
A: No. CVF is agent-agnostic. Use it with Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, local LLMs — all work.

**Q: I'm just one person, do I need anything else?**  
A: You only need: CVF_v1.5.2_SKILL_LIBRARY_FOR_END_USERS/ + this guide. Skip governance, templates, architecture.
