## Skill 1: Context Engineering Optimizer (AGT-021)

### What It Does

Framework-level skill for **optimizing token context** in agent workflows. Monitors context health, detects degradation patterns, and triggers compaction when needed.

### When to Use

- Context window approaching 70-80% utilization
- Agent performance degrading over long sessions
- Multi-agent workflows with high token costs
- Need to optimize prompt structure for cache hit rates

### Key Concept: Four-Bucket Strategy

```
Write (save external) → Select (pull relevant) → Compress (reduce tokens) → Isolate (split sub-agents)
```

### Chat Prompt Examples

```
"Analyze my current context health — what's the token utilization?"
"Optimize context: move critical information to beginning/end positions"
"Trigger compaction — target 50-70% reduction with less than 5% quality loss"
"Set up context monitoring for this multi-agent workflow"
```

### TypeScript Integration

```typescript
import { ContextEngineering } from '@cvf/agent-skills';

const optimizer = new ContextEngineering({
  governance: { risk: 'R1', approval: 'auto_audit' }
});

// Monitor context health
const health = await optimizer.analyze({
  currentTokens: 85000,
  maxTokens: 128000,
  criticalSections: ['system-prompt', 'user-context', 'tool-results']
});

console.log(health);
// {
//   utilization: 0.66,
//   warning: false,
//   degradationRisk: 'low',
//   recommendations: ['Move critical info to beginning/end positions']
// }

// Trigger compaction when needed
if (health.utilization > 0.7) {
  const result = await optimizer.compact({
    strategy: 'four-bucket',
    targetReduction: 0.6,       // 60% reduction
    maxQualityLoss: 0.05,       // ≤5% quality degradation
    preserveSections: ['system-prompt', 'recent-context']
  });
  console.log(`Reduced from ${result.before} to ${result.after} tokens`);
}
```

### Anti-Patterns Detected

| Anti-Pattern | Correction |
|-------------|------------|
| Exhaustive context loading | Curated high-signal tokens only |
| Critical info in middle positions | Move to beginning/end (U-shaped attention curve) |
| No compaction before limits | Trigger at 70-80% utilization |
| Tools without descriptions | Apply 4-question framework: what, when, inputs, returns |

## Skill 2: Problem-Solving Framework Router (AGT-022)

### What It Does

Meta-skill that **dispatches to the right problem-solving technique** based on how you're stuck. Doesn't solve problems directly — it identifies the optimal approach.

### When to Use

- Architecture is getting too complex
- Need a breakthrough idea
- Seeing the same pattern across multiple places
- Assumptions feel wrong but can't pinpoint why
- Unsure if a solution will scale

### Decision Tree

```
STUCK?
├─ Technical bug?               → AGT-023 (Systematic Debugging)
├─ Architecture too complex?    → Simplification Cascades
├─ Need breakthrough idea?      → Collision Zone Thinking
├─ Seeing repeated patterns?    → Meta-Pattern Recognition
├─ Assumptions feel wrong?      → Inversion Exercise
├─ Unsure about scale?          → Scale Game
└─ Multiple independent issues? → AGT-018 (parallel sub-agents)
```

### Chat Prompt Examples

```
"I'm stuck — this architecture keeps growing more special cases. Help me simplify."
"I need an innovative approach — conventional solutions aren't working."
"I keep seeing the same problem in different parts of the codebase."
"Something feels wrong about our assumptions but I can't figure out what."
"Will this approach work at 1000x the current scale?"
```

### The 6 Techniques

**1. Simplification Cascades** — When complexity spirals

```
Find one insight that eliminates multiple components at once.
Look for: same thing done 5+ ways, growing special cases.
```

**2. Collision Zone Thinking** — When you need innovation

```
Force unrelated concepts together to discover emergent properties.
Example: "What if our auth system worked like a biological immune system?"
```

**3. Meta-Pattern Recognition** — When recurring patterns appear

```
Spot patterns appearing in 3+ domains.
Action: Abstract the pattern, solve it once, apply everywhere.
```

**4. Inversion Exercise** — When forced by assumptions

```
Flip core assumptions to reveal hidden constraints.
Ask: "What if we did the exact opposite?"
```

**5. Scale Game** — When unsure about production

```
Test at extremes: 1000x bigger AND 1000x smaller.
Reveals: true bottlenecks, unnecessary complexity, scale invariants.
```

**6. Combine Techniques**

```
Simplification + Meta-pattern: Find pattern → simplify all instances
Collision + Inversion:         Force metaphor → invert its assumptions
Scale + Simplification:        Extremes reveal what to eliminate
```

## Skill 3: Systematic Debugging Engine (AGT-023)

### What It Does

4-phase debugging methodology that ensures **root cause investigation BEFORE any fix attempts**. Prevents the common AI anti-pattern of "guess-and-fix" cycles.

### The Iron Law
>
> **NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

### When to Use

- Code producing wrong behavior
- Tests failing unexpectedly
- System errors after changes
- Performance regressions
- After 2+ failed fix attempts (MUST use this)

### The Four Phases

```
Phase 1: Root Cause     →  Phase 2: Pattern      →  Phase 3: Hypothesis   →  Phase 4: Implementation
      ↓                          ↓                         ↓                         ↓
 Read errors              Find working examples     Form single theory      Create failing test
 Reproduce                Compare differences       Test minimally          Implement single fix
 Check recent changes     Identify gaps             One variable at a time  Verify fix
 Trace data flow          Understand dependencies   Confirm or reject       Document
```

### Chat Prompt Examples

```
"Debug this failing test — start with Phase 1 root cause investigation."
"The API returns 500 after the last deploy. Trace the data flow."
"I've tried fixing this 3 times already — use systematic debugging from scratch."
"Compare this broken module with the working version in the other service."
```

### TypeScript Integration

```typescript
import { SystematicDebugger } from '@cvf/agent-skills';

const debugger = new SystematicDebugger({
  governance: { risk: 'R2', approval: 'supervised' }
});

// Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation
const investigation = await debugger.investigate({
  error: errorMessage,
  stackTrace: trace,
  recentChanges: await git.diff('HEAD~3'),
  affectedFiles: ['src/auth/service.ts', 'src/auth/middleware.ts']
});

// Phase 2: Pattern Analysis
const patterns = await debugger.analyzePatterns({
  workingExample: 'src/user/service.ts',
  brokenComponent: 'src/auth/service.ts',
  differences: investigation.differences
});

// Phase 3: Hypothesis
const hypothesis = debugger.formHypothesis({
  rootCause: investigation.rootCause,
  evidence: patterns.evidence,
  // Single hypothesis: "X is root cause because Y"
});

// Phase 4: Implementation (only after hypothesis confirmed)
if (hypothesis.confirmed) {
  const fix = await debugger.implement({
    failingTest: 'tests/auth.test.ts',
    singleFix: hypothesis.proposedFix,
    verifyCommand: 'npm test'
  });
  // MUST verify: actual test output shows 0 failures
  console.log(fix.verificationEvidence);
}
```

### Red Flags — STOP and Return to Phase 1

- ❌ "Just try changing X and see"
- ❌ "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- ❌ "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- ❌ "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- ❌ "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures)
- ❌ Proposing solutions before tracing data flow

### Escalation Rule
>
> **If 3+ fixes fail → STOP → Question architecture.** Escalate to Architect role.

## Skill 4: MCP Context Isolation Manager (AGT-024)

### What It Does

Architectural pattern for **delegating MCP tool calls to a dedicated subagent**, keeping the main agent's context clean. Solves the "context bloat" problem where loading multiple MCP servers pollutes the primary context window.

### Key Principle
>
> MCP tool discovery and execution happen in an isolated subagent context. The main agent only receives the result, not the 1000+ tool definitions.

### When to Use

- Working with 3+ MCP servers simultaneously
- Context window getting bloated by tool definitions
- Need to preserve main context quality during MCP-heavy workflows
- Managing 10-80+ MCP servers for enterprise setups

### Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│     Main Agent           │
│  (clean context)         │
│                          │
│  "I need to use MCP X"   │
│         │                │
│         ▼                │
│  ┌──────────────┐        │
│  │ Dispatch to   │        │
│  │ MCP Subagent  │        │
│  └──────┬───────┘        │
│         │                │
└─────────┼────────────────┘
          ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│   MCP Manager Subagent   │
│  (isolated context)      │
│                          │
│  1. Load .mcp.json       │
│  2. Initialize servers   │
│  3. Discover tools       │
│  4. Select best tool     │
│  5. Execute tool         │
│  6. Return result only   │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### Chat Prompt Examples

```
"Use the GitHub MCP server to list my open PRs — isolate it from main context."
"Set up context isolation for these 5 MCP servers."
"How much context am I saving with MCP isolation vs direct loading?"
"Run a database query through the MCP subagent and return just the results."
```

### Context Savings

| Metric | Without Isolation | With Isolation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Context overhead per MCP server | ~500-2000 tokens | ~0 tokens (main) |
| 10 MCP servers cost | ~10,000 tokens | ~50 tokens (dispatch) |
| Tool discovery time | Immediate (bloated) | On-demand (clean) |
| Main context quality | Degraded | Preserved |

### TypeScript Integration

```typescript
import { MCPIsolationManager } from '@cvf/agent-skills';

const mcp = new MCPIsolationManager({
  governance: { risk: 'R2', approval: 'supervised' },
  timeout: 30000,
  maxServers: 80
});

// Configure MCP servers (main context stays clean)
mcp.configure({
  servers: [
    { name: 'github', config: '.mcp/github.json' },
    { name: 'database', config: '.mcp/postgres.json' },
    { name: 'slack', config: '.mcp/slack.json' }
  ],
  security: {
    credentialSource: 'environment',    // Never in context
    allowList: ['github', 'database'],  // Explicit server allowlist
    resultSanitization: true            // Filter sensitive data
  }
});

// Execute via isolated subagent
const result = await mcp.execute({
  server: 'github',
  action: 'list_pull_requests',
  params: { state: 'open', author: '@me' },
  // Only the result comes back to main context
  resultFormat: 'summary'
});

console.log(result);
// { prs: [...], tokensSaved: 1847, subagentDuration: '2.3s' }
```

### Security Model

- MCP credentials managed via **environment variables** (never in context)
- Subagent has **limited permissions**: execute MCP tools only
- Results **filtered for sensitive data** before returning
- Server **allowlist** enforced via governance configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Try AGT-022 first** — it's R0 (fully automatic) and helps you choose the right approach
2. **Monitor context with AGT-021** — especially during long sessions
3. **Use AGT-023 for debugging** — the Iron Law prevents wasted time
4. **Set up AGT-024** if you use 3+ MCP servers
5. **Review the analysis report** — `docs/CVF_CLAUDEKIT_SKILLS_ANALYSIS_2026-02-18.md`
