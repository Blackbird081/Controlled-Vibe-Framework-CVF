# Version Evolution

CVF has evolved through 6 versions, each adding a layer of capability while preserving backward compatibility. All versions prior to v1.6 are **frozen** — meaning their specifications are final and will not change.

## Which Version Should You Use?

| If you are... | Start with | Then explore |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| A solo developer, just curious | **v1.0** (read manifesto) | v1.6 (try web UI) |
| A developer wanting structure | **v1.1** (governance) | v1.3 (CLI tools) |
| A team needing risk management | **v1.2** (risk model) | v1.6 (visual risk) |
| An ops/DevOps engineer | **v1.3** (SDK, CI/CD) | v1.6 (web platform) |
| A non-technical team member | **v1.6** (web UI, end-user friendly) | — |
| Everyone going forward | **v1.6** (current, all features) | — |

### Quick Recommendation

- **New to CVF?** → Start with [START_HERE.md](../../START_HERE.md) and the v1.6 web UI
- **Want to understand the philosophy?** → Read the [v1.0 Manifesto](../../v1.0/CVF_MANIFESTO.md)
- **Need formal governance?** → Study v1.1 governance model
- **Need risk controls?** → Study v1.2 risk model + [Risk Model concept](risk-model.md)
- **Want tools?** → Use v1.3 CLI/SDK
- **Want the full experience?** → Use v1.6 web platform

## Backward Compatibility

Each version **extends** the previous — it never breaks it.

```
v1.0 → v1.1 → v1.2 → v1.3 → v1.5 → v1.6
 +        +        +        +        +        +
 |        |        |        |        |        |
 phases   roles    risk     tools    UX      web
 gates    agents   skills   SDK     users    app
 logging  cmds     caps     CLI     library  chat
```

If you use v1.6, you automatically have access to all concepts from v1.0–v1.5.

## Frozen vs. Active

| Status | Meaning | Versions |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **FROZEN** | Spec is final, no changes | v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, v1.4, v1.5 |
| **ACTIVE** | Under active development | v1.6 |

Frozen doesn't mean obsolete — it means stable and reliable. The v1.0 manifesto is as valid today as when it was written.
