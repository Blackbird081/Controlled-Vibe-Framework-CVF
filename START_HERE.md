## Why The Change?

We consolidated multiple entry points (START_HERE, CVF_LITE, QUICK_START) into one comprehensive guide at `docs/GET_STARTED.md`.

**Previously:** 3+ entry points → confusion, overlap  
**Now:** 1 true entry point → clear path

This reduces confusion and makes onboarding faster.

### What's New (Feb 15, 2026)

✅ **docs/GET_STARTED.md** - Comprehensive guide with 3 personas  
✅ **docs/guides/** - Role-based guides (solo, team, enterprise)  
✅ **docs/tutorials/** - Step-by-step tutorials (4 tutorials)  
✅ **docs/concepts/** - Deep dives (6 concepts)  
✅ **docs/cheatsheets/** - Quick references  
✅ **scripts/quick-start.sh** - One-command setup

See: [Implementation Roadmap](docs/CVF_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_2026-02-15.md)

## Old Content (Archived)

The previous START_HERE content (Phase 1-4 reports) has been archived as it referenced outdated assessments with incorrect scores (9.1-9.4/10).

**Current realistic assessment:** 7.5/10 ([Read why](docs/CVF_INDEPENDENT_ASSESSMENT_2026-02-15.md))
