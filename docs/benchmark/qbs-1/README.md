# QBS-1 Runner And Corpus Planning

Status: `QBS5_POWERED_SINGLE_PROVIDER_EXECUTION_FAILED_NO_SCORE`

QBS-1 is the first implementation planning packet for the CVF Quality Benchmark
Suite. It translates the public methodology into concrete runner, corpus,
scoring, artifact, and pre-registration requirements.

This folder does not contain scored benchmark results. The first calibration
pilot is published under
[`../runs/qbs1-calibration-20260509-three-provider/`](../runs/qbs1-calibration-20260509-three-provider/README.md)
as harness proof only.

## Planning Packet

- [Corpus Candidate](corpus-candidate.md)
- [Powered Single-Provider Corpus V1](powered-single-provider-corpus-v1.json)
- [Runner Contract](runner-contract.md)
- [Scoring Rubric](scoring-rubric.md)
- [Artifact Layout](artifact-layout.md)
- [Pre-Registration Template](preregistration-template.md)
- [Scored Run Readiness](scored-run-readiness.md)
- [Alibaba Powered Single-Provider Pre-Registration](preregistrations/qbs1-powered-single-provider-20260510-alibaba.md)

Runner entry point:

```bash
python scripts/run_qbs_calibration_pilot.py --preregistration-tag qbs/preregister/<run-id>
```

Readiness checker:

```bash
python scripts/check_qbs_scored_run_readiness.py --json
```

## Gate State

| Gate | State |
|---|---|
| QBS-1 corpus design | `UNLOCKED` |
| QBS-1 powered corpus JSON | `READY_FOR_PREREGISTRATION` |
| QBS-1 runner harness design | `CALIBRATION_RUNNER_AVAILABLE` |
| QBS-1 calibration pilot | `PASS_NO_QBS_SCORE` |
| QBS-1 scored-run readiness packet | `PASS` |
| QBS-1 scored-run pre-registration | `PREREGISTERED` as `qbs/preregister/qbs1-powered-single-provider-20260510-alibaba` |
| QBS-1 powered execution | `FAILED_NO_SCORE` for `qbs1-powered-single-provider-20260510-alibaba` |
| QBS-1 scored claim | `BLOCKED` until hard gates pass and reviewer scoring completes |
| Family-level claims under `POWERED_SINGLE_PROVIDER` | `BLOCKED` |
| Public QBS score | `NOT_CLAIMED` |

## Next Authorized Work

QBS-1 may proceed from calibration into corpus expansion, reviewer workflow
design, and scored-run readiness checks. A scored run may not start until a
run-specific pre-registration tag freezes the corpus, criteria, configs,
provider/model list, reviewer plan, and artifact path.
