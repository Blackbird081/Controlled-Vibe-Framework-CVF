## Post-Cycle Validation Tracker

| Validation line | State |
|---|---|
| `W6-T1` to `W6-T42` checkpoint archive | `DONE / ARCHIVED` |
| `W6-T43` controlled-intelligence bugfix protocol tests | `DONE` |
| `W6-T44` controlled-intelligence verification policy tests | `DONE` |
| W7 Governance Integration Wave | `ALL W7-T0 through W7-T10 CLOSED DELIVERED — 11 schemas, 32 presets, P1-P8 gates satisfied` |
| Current canonical validation posture | `W7-T10 COMPLETE — W7 INTEGRATION WAVE CLOSED; current whitepaper baseline synchronized to v3.2-W12T1` |

## Quick Interpretation

- If a tranche is `DONE`, its approved tranche boundary is already closed.
- If no tranche is currently active, the currently authorized line is canonically closed and any further work needs a new `GC-018` decision.
- If an area is `PARTIAL`, CVF already has usable delivered slices there, but not the full whitepaper target-state.
- This tracker only reflects canonically committed closures; worktree-only slices do not count until their governed packet chain is committed.
