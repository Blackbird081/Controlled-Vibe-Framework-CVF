# CVF W2-T7 CP1 Review — Async Command Runtime Contract

Memory class: SUMMARY_RECORD

> Governance control: `GC-019`
> Date: `2026-03-22`
> Tranche: `W2-T7 — Execution Command Runtime Async Slice`
> Control Point: `CP1 — Async Command Runtime Contract (Full Lane)`

---

## Review Summary

CP1 delivers `execution.async.runtime.contract.ts` — first async execution surface in the execution plane.

---

## Deliverable Review

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Input type | `CommandRuntimeResult` (from W2-T3 CP1) |
| Output type | `AsyncCommandRuntimeTicket` — async tracking wrapper |
| `asyncStatus` on issue | Always `"PENDING"` — correct lifecycle start |
| `estimatedTimeoutMs` | `max(1000, executedCount * 1000)` — deterministic, injectable |
| Hash stability | Confirmed — identical inputs produce identical `ticketHash` |
| Dependency injection | `estimateTimeout` and `now` both injectable |
| Cross-tranche bridge | `sourceRuntimeId` and `sourceGateId` preserve W2-T3 lineage |
| Tests | 8 passing |

---

## Findings

No deficiencies. CP1 closes the W2-T3 explicit defer "async adapter invocation." The ticket pattern mirrors W4-T5 LearningReinjectionContract — a governance-layer async tracking object, not a runtime executor.

---

## Review Result

**APPROVED — CP1 complete. Proceed to CP2.**
