## Review Verdict

**APPROVED — CP1 DELIVERED**

## Evidence Checklist

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| GC-018 authorization present | PASS (10/10) |
| Contract file created | PASS (`execution.feedback.consumer.pipeline.contract.ts`) |
| Cross-plane import pattern (EPF→CPF) | PASS (same as W2-T10) |
| Determinism pattern followed | PASS (`now` injected, propagated to both sub-contracts) |
| Hash IDs use `computeDeterministicHash` | PASS |
| `resultId ≠ pipelineHash` | PASS |
| Warning pattern ([feedback] prefix, class-based) | PASS |
| Dedicated test file (GC-023) | PASS (`execution.feedback.consumer.pipeline.test.ts`) |
| EPF `index.test.ts` not modified | PASS (still 1952 lines) |
| 18 new tests, all pass | PASS (475 EPF total, 0 failures) |
| Partition registry updated | PASS |
| Barrel export added | PASS |

## Scope Boundary

- Additive EPF→CPF cross-plane contract only
- No modification to: `ExecutionFeedbackContract`, `ControlPlaneConsumerPipelineContract`, EPF `index.test.ts`
- Gap closed: W2-T4 implied — feedback signals now have a governed consumer path

## Next Step

CP2: `ExecutionFeedbackConsumerPipelineBatchContract` — Fast Lane (GC-021)
