## 1. Purpose

This roadmap exists to answer one question:

**If CVF chooses to continue toward the full target-state described in the whitepaper, what is the safest next governed sequence?**

It does **not** reopen the just-completed restructuring wave by itself.

---

## 2. Starting Point

What is already complete:

- current-cycle federated restructuring `Phase 0-4`
- approved `B*` merge pack
- `GC-019` structural-change discipline
- active-path governed execution remains strong

What is still incomplete against the whitepaper target-state:

- target control-plane completion
- target execution-plane completion
- target learning-plane completion
- proposal-derived governance subsystems such as `Audit / Consensus`

---

Nothing beyond `W0` in this roadmap may execute until:

1. a follow-up `GC-018` or equivalent governed decision authorizes the first implementation tranche, or
2. an independent reassessment explicitly reshapes the next-wave priority

After `W0`, every major structural change in this roadmap must still pass `GC-019`.

---

## 4. Next-Wave Goal

Move CVF from:

- completed current-cycle federated restructuring

to:

- a broader, more explicit platform structure that closes the highest-value whitepaper target-state gaps without losing current-cycle stability

---

## 5. Proposed Workstreams

### Workstream A — Control Plane Completion

Goal:

- close the largest remaining whitepaper gap in the control plane

Focus:

- `AI Gateway`
- knowledge-layer completion
- context-builder / packager convergence

Definition of done:

- target control-plane responsibilities become explicit runtime/package surfaces rather than diagram-only concepts

### Workstream B — Execution Plane Completion

Goal:

- turn the remaining execution target-state pieces into governed, testable modules

Focus:

- command runtime
- MCP bridge completion
- stronger model-gateway target-state completion where still partial

Definition of done:

- execution target-state becomes reviewable through real packages, handlers, and receipts rather than concept-only whitepaper blocks

### Workstream C — Governance Completion Beyond Current Cycle

Goal:

- decide whether proposal-only governance subsystems belong in the next wave

Focus:

- `Audit / Consensus`
- `CVF Watchdog`
- any governance expansion not already delivered in the current baseline

Definition of done:

- each governance target is either:
  - implemented through approved packets, or
  - explicitly deferred with a closure rationale

### Workstream D — Learning Plane Completion

Goal:

- move the learning plane from concept to governed platform capability

Focus:

- truth-model shape
- evaluation engine
- feedback loop into governance
- observability alignment

Definition of done:

- learning-plane architecture exists as concrete, reviewable subsystems rather than only diagram intent

### Workstream E — Final Whitepaper Truth Reconciliation

Goal:

- close the gap between target-state concept and current implementation truth

Focus:

- update the whitepaper status from “target-state only” to evidence-backed partial or completed layers
- issue a fresh independent system review
- decide which whitepaper sections are now current truth vs still target-state

Definition of done:

- whitepaper truth layers can be re-labeled from evidence instead of aspiration

## 5A. Clarified Planning Rule

As clarified by:

- `docs/reviews/CVF_WHITEPAPER_SCOPE_CLARIFICATION_PACKET_2026-03-22.md`

The roadmap should now be read with one additional rule:

- do **not** treat packaging-only continuation as the default next step
- do prioritize one usable realization slice at a time
- do defer concept-only targets explicitly when they are not source-backed
- do treat validation/test-only continuation as a stop-boundary case once tranche-local confidence is already strong; further breadth must prove a real release/runtime/governance decision gain
- do treat truth-label or claim-expansion continuation as a stop-boundary case; status relabeling may continue only when new evidence materially changes the canonical posture
- do preserve the context-continuity model across later tranches:
  - `memory = repository of facts, history, and durable evidence`
  - `handoff = governance-filtered summary and transfer checkpoint`
  - `context loading = phase-bounded loading of only what the current step needs`

Operational implication:

- the preferred next move is a usable intake slice
- `W4` should not be auto-opened just because `W3` is closed
- `Watchdog`, `Audit / Consensus`, and the `Learning Plane` remain later scopes for explicit reasons, not because they were forgotten
- once a validation wave reaches diminishing returns, the next governed move should usually shift laterally to the largest unresolved architecture or product gap instead of expanding test breadth by habit
- handoff should now be read as context quality control by phase for multi-agent continuation, not only as pause/transfer etiquette

---

## 6. Proposed Delivery Order

Recommended order if this roadmap is authorized:

1. one usable intake slice across `AI Gateway -> Knowledge Layer -> Context Builder / Packager`
2. one usable design/orchestration slice across `AI Boardroom -> CEO Orchestrator`
3. selective execution deepening only where it unlocks a real consumer path
4. concept-only governance targets only when they become source-backed and operationally necessary
5. learning-plane completion only after lower-plane artifacts and feedback semantics are stable
6. final whitepaper truth reconciliation

Reasoning:

- usable intake and orchestration slices create value sooner than finishing more wrappers
- governance additions should only expand once they are tied to real plane behavior
- learning should remain late because its core `Truth Model` and `Evaluation Engine` are not yet source-backed
- truth reconciliation belongs after realization evidence exists, not after more packaging alone

**W4 Learning Plane: ALL 7 TRANCHES CLOSED DELIVERED — observability slice delivered; learning plane fully observable.**

**W3 Governance Watchdog: DEFERRED → PARTIAL — first cross-plane watchdog pulse delivered through W3-T2.**

**W3 Governance Audit/Consensus: DEFERRED → PARTIAL — first governed audit signal delivered through W3-T3. Both W3-T1 defers resolved.**

**Execution MCP Bridge: PARTIAL → SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED — first operational MCP invocation slice delivered through W2-T8. W2-T1 CP2 defer "MCP internals deferred" closed.**

**Control-plane AI Gateway routing: W1-T4 HTTP routing defer closed by W1-T7 (`RouteMatchContract`). Gateway now has three governed surfaces.**

**Control-plane AI Gateway tenant auth: W1-T4 multi-tenant auth defer closed by W1-T8 (`GatewayAuthContract`). Five governed gateway surfaces.**

**Control-plane AI Gateway NLP-PII: W1-T4 LAST defer "NLP-based PII detection" closed by W1-T9. All 3 W1-T4 defers resolved. AI Gateway: PARTIAL → SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED. Seven governed surfaces. Full safety chain complete.**

**Knowledge Layer foundation: first operational Knowledge Layer slice delivered through W1-T10 (`KnowledgeQueryContract`). Relevance-filtered ranked retrieval. Knowledge Layer gap: no operational slice → first slice delivered.**

**Post-cycle continuation note (2026-03-23): W1-T11 Context Builder foundation slice is also CLOSED DELIVERED. `ContextBuildRequest → ContextPackage → ContextBuildBatch` now exists as the first operational Context Builder path in CVF.**

Future continuation requires new GC-018 authorization per wave.

## 7. Suggested Phases

### Phase W0 — Reopen And Scope

- raise new `GC-018` packet
- select only the highest-value whitepaper gaps
- define no more than one execution tranche ahead

Current status:

- `COMPLETE`
- canonical outputs:
  - `docs/roadmaps/CVF_WHITEPAPER_W0_SCOPED_BACKLOG_2026-03-21.md`
  - `docs/reviews/CVF_WHITEPAPER_FIRST_TRANCHE_PACKET_2026-03-21.md`
  - `docs/reviews/CVF_GC018_CONTINUATION_CANDIDATE_W1_T1_2026-03-21.md`

- explicit defer posture:
  - `Watchdog` and `Audit / Consensus` remain concept-only and not implemented as standalone modules

### Phase W4 — Learning Plane

- introduce the learning plane only after the lower planes are stable

Current authorized scope:

- `W4-T1 — Learning Plane Foundation Slice` — **CLOSED DELIVERED**
- W4 gate: **OPENED** (prerequisite `ExecutionFeedbackSignal` established by W2-T4)
- `W4-T1` closed: `LearningFeedbackInput[] → FeedbackLedger → PatternInsight`
- `W4-T2` closed: `PatternInsight[] → TruthModel` and `TruthModel + PatternInsight → TruthModel`
- `W4-T3` closed: `TruthModel → EvaluationResult` and `EvaluationResult[] → ThresholdAssessment`; first learning-plane evaluation surface; W4 foundation complete
- `W4-T4` closed: `ThresholdAssessment → GovernanceSignal` and `GovernanceSignal[] → GovernanceSignalLog`; first cross-plane governance signal from learning plane; W4 deferred scope "governance action surface" delivered
- `W4-T5` closed: `GovernanceSignal → LearningFeedbackInput` and `GovernanceSignal[] → LearningLoopSummary`; W4 feedback re-injection loop closed; W4 deferred scope exhausted
- `W4-T6` closed: learning-plane persistent storage slice delivered
- `W4-T7` closed: learning-plane observability slice delivered; final explicit W4 observability gap closed
- cross-plane independence: CONFIRMED — learning plane defines its own input interfaces; no runtime coupling to EPF/CPF
- deferred scope: none within the first W4 completion cycle

### Phase W5 — Whitepaper Closure Review

- rerun independent review
- re-label whitepaper sections according to delivered truth

---

## 8. Success Metrics

This roadmap should only be considered successful if it produces all of the following:

1. at least `3` current whitepaper target-state blocks become concrete packages or governed subsystems
2. at least `1` new control-plane and `1` new execution-plane target become evidence-backed rather than conceptual
3. every new structural change passes `GC-019`
4. a new independent review can upgrade the whitepaper readout from “partial against target-state”

---

## 9. Stop Rules

Stop the wave when:

- new work mostly adds architecture narrative without executable closure
- platform complexity rises faster than governance confidence
- learning-plane ambition starts outrunning lower-plane maturity
- the strongest remaining gap changes and a newer reassessment supersedes this roadmap

---

## 10. Practical Meaning

This roadmap means:

- CVF does have a clean next step after the completed restructuring wave
- that next step is **whitepaper completion**, not random breadth expansion
- but the next step is now clarified as `realization-first`, not `packaging-first`
- but any future continuation beyond this completed cycle remains governed and unopened until a fresh `GC-018` decision says otherwise

---

## Final Readout

> **Governed successor roadmap** — correct direction for completing the whitepaper target-state.

> **Updated readout:** `W0` is complete, all authorized tranches through `W5-T1` are canonically closed, and the first whitepaper-completion verification cycle is finished. Post-cycle continuation is now closed through `W1-T18`, `W2-T17`, and `W3-T15`. `W1` substantially delivers the control-plane line, `W2` substantially delivers the execution-plane line, `W3` substantially delivers the governance-expansion line, `W4` substantially delivers the learning-plane line, and `W5-T1` closes the first evidence-backed truth reconciliation cycle. No tranche is currently active, and any continuation beyond the currently closed line still requires a fresh `GC-018` decision.
