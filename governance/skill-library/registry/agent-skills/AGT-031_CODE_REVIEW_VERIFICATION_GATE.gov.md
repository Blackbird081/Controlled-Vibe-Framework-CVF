## Purpose

Systematic code review methodology enforcing **technical rigor over social performance**. Three distinct practices: receiving feedback correctly, requesting structured reviews, and verification gates that require evidence before any completion claims.

---

## Core Principle

> **Technical correctness over social comfort.** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Evidence before claims.

---

## Three Practices Overview

| Practice | Trigger | Protocol |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Receiving Feedback** | Code review comments arrive | READ → UNDERSTAND → VERIFY → EVALUATE → RESPOND → IMPLEMENT |
| **Requesting Review** | Task/feature completed | Dispatch code-reviewer subagent with SHA context |
| **Verification Gate** | About to claim success | IDENTIFY → RUN → READ → VERIFY → THEN CLAIM |

---

## Practice 1: Receiving Feedback

### Response Protocol
```
READ → UNDERSTAND → VERIFY → EVALUATE → RESPOND → IMPLEMENT
```

### Forbidden Patterns (Performative Agreement)
| ❌ NEVER Say | ✅ Say Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "You're absolutely right!" | "I understand the concern about X. Let me verify..." |
| "Great point!" | "Checking if this applies to our context..." |
| "Thanks for catching that!" | "Verified — the issue exists at line 42. Implementing fix." |
| "I completely agree" | "After reviewing: [technical assessment]" |

### Feedback Source Handling

```
Who gave feedback?
│
├─ Human partner (trusted)
│  → Understand intent
│  → Implement after verification
│  → No performative agreement — just work
│
├─ External reviewer
│  → Verify technically correct
│  → Check for context they might be missing
│  → Push back with evidence if wrong
│  → Implement only if verified correct
│
└─ Automated tool (linter, CI)
   → Check if rule is valid for this context
   → Fix if legitimate, suppress with reason if not
```

### YAGNI Check Protocol
Before implementing any "suggested improvement":
```
1. Grep for actual usage of the suggested pattern
2. Verify the problem actually exists (not theoretical)
3. If no evidence of problem → don't implement
4. If evidence exists → implement with test proving fix
```

## Practice 2: Requesting Review

### When to Request
- After completing each task in multi-step development
- After major feature or refactor completion
- Before merge to main branch
- After fixing complex bugs
- When stuck and need fresh perspective

### Review Request Template
```
REVIEW REQUEST:
─────────────────────────
What was implemented: [description]
Plan/Requirements: [link or summary]
Base SHA: [git rev-parse HEAD~N]
Head SHA: [git rev-parse HEAD]
Files changed: [list key files]
Risk areas: [parts most likely to have issues]
Test coverage: [what's tested, what's not]
─────────────────────────
```

### Acting on Review Feedback

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Critical** | Fix immediately, block merge | Before any other work |
| **Important** | Fix before proceeding to next task | Same session |
| **Minor** | Note for later, create TODO | Next available slot |
| **Stylistic** | Apply if team standard, skip if preference | On merge prep |

---

## Practice 3: Verification Gates

### The Iron Law

> **NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE**

### Verification Gate Protocol
```
IDENTIFY the verification command needed
       │
       ▼
RUN the full command (not partial, not cached)
       │
       ▼
READ the complete output (not just exit code)
       │
       ▼
VERIFY output confirms the claim
       │
       ▼
THEN (and only then) state the claim WITH evidence
```

### Gate Requirements by Claim Type

| Claim | Required Evidence | Verification Command |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Tests pass" | Test output showing 0 failures | `npm test` / `pytest` full output |
| "Build succeeds" | Build command with exit 0 | `npm run build` full output |
| "Bug is fixed" | Original symptom no longer reproduces | Test that exercises the bug |
| "Feature complete" | Line-by-line requirements checklist | Each requirement verified |
| "No regressions" | Full test suite + affected area tests | `npm test` + targeted tests |
| "Ready to deploy" | All above + security scan | Full CI pipeline pass |

### Red Flags — STOP Immediately

If you catch yourself:
- Using "should"/"probably"/"seems to" → **STOP, run verification**
- Expressing satisfaction before running tests → **STOP, run tests first**
- About to commit without verification → **STOP, verify everything**
- Trusting previous test run (>5 minutes old) → **STOP, run again**
- Any wording implying success without evidence → **STOP, get evidence**

## Decision Tree: Complete Review Flow

```
SITUATION?
│
├─ Received feedback
│  ├─ Unclear items? → STOP, ask for clarification on ALL unclear items
│  ├─ From human partner? → Understand, verify, then implement (no performative agreement)
│  ├─ From external reviewer? → Verify technically, push back if wrong
│  └─ From automated tool? → Check if rule applies to context
│
├─ Completed work
│  ├─ Major feature/task? → Request structured review
│  ├─ Bug fix? → Request review focused on root cause
│  └─ Before merge? → Full review with test evidence
│
└─ About to claim status
   ├─ Have fresh verification (<5 min)? → State claim WITH evidence
   └─ No fresh verification? → RUN verification first, then claim
```

## Integration with CVF Workflow

### With AGT-026 (Testing)
```
Code Change → AGT-026 Testing Pyramid → AGT-031 Review → Verification Gate → Merge
```

### With AGT-023 (Debugging)
```
Bug Report → AGT-023 Root Cause → Fix → AGT-031 Verification Gate → Confirm Fix
```

### With AGT-030 (Deployment)
```
Feature Complete → AGT-031 Review → AGT-026 CI Gates → AGT-030 Deploy
```

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | 💥 Why It's Harmful | ✅ Correct Approach |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Performative agreement | Masks lack of understanding | Technical assessment first |
| Implementing before verifying feedback | May introduce new bugs | Verify feedback is correct first |
| Claiming "done" without running tests | False confidence, broken code | Run full verification, show evidence |
| Batch-reviewing at the end | Accumulated tech debt, costly fixes | Review after each task/feature |
| Skipping review for "small changes" | Small changes cause most outages | All changes get verification gate |
| Trusting cached/stale test results | Environment may have changed | Always run fresh verification |

---

## Constraints
- Verification gates are NON-NEGOTIABLE — no claims without fresh evidence
- Code review responses must NEVER include performative agreement patterns
- External feedback must be technically verified before implementation
- Review requests must include SHA context for reproducibility
