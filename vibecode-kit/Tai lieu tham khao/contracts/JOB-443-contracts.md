# JOB-443 - Contracts

## Scope
- Development of a complete web-based lesson planning system for teachers.
- Implementation of features including user authentication, lesson plan creation, and resource sharing.
- Deployment of the application on the specified platforms.

## Out of Scope
- Development of mobile applications (native or hybrid).
- Integration with third-party services or external databases not specified in the project.
- Advanced analytics or reporting features beyond the basic lesson planning functionality.

## STEP-2 Definition
### Deliverables:
- A fully functioning web application that includes:
  - Frontend built in React.js and Next.js.
  - Backend APIs developed in Node.js and Express.js.
  - A MongoDB database with necessary schemas and data models.
  - Complete documentation on how to run and deploy the application.

## GATE Criteria
1. All features must be implemented as per the design specifications.
2. Code must pass all unit tests and integration tests.
3. Application must be free of critical bugs and performance issues.
4. User acceptance testing (UAT) must be completed with positive feedback from at least three users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application is deployed and accessible online.
- Users can successfully register, log in, and create lesson plans.
- The UI is responsive and meets accessibility standards.
- All API endpoints return the expected responses as documented.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Delays in development due to unforeseen technical challenges.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement agile methodologies with regular sprint reviews to adjust timelines.
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in user authentication.
  - **Mitigation**: Use established libraries for authentication and conduct security audits.
- **Risk**: Low user adoption due to poor UX design.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct user testing sessions throughout the development process to gather feedback and iterate on design.
