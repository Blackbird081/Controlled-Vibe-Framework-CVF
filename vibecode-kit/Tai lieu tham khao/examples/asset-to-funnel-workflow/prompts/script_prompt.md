## Script Types

1. **Problem-Solution** - Start with pain, reveal solution
2. **Myth Buster** - Challenge common belief
3. **How-To Quick** - One actionable tip
4. **Story Snippet** - Mini transformation story
5. **Hot Take** - Bold opinion with reasoning

## Hook Formulas

Use these patterns for opening lines:
- "Stop doing X if you want Y..."
- "The real reason you're not getting X..."
- "I used to think X, but then..."
- "What nobody tells you about X..."
- "3 seconds to change how you think about X..."

## Quality Criteria

- Hook must work in first 3 seconds
- Script should sound spoken, not written
- Each point should be one breath/one idea
- CTA must be specific and achievable
- Total word count should match target duration (~150 words/minute)
- Must be filmable by one person with phone
