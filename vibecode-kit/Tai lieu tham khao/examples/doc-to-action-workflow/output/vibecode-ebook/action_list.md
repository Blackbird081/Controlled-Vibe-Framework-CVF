# Action Checklist

## Who this is for
- AI founders and project leads who want to teach others how to work effectively with AI in software projects using the Vibecode framework, especially non-coders or low-code users.

## Phase 1 – Project Setup & Planning
- ⭐ Set up essential tools: computer with internet, ChatGPT account, Claude Code account, and a cloud storage (Google Drive recommended).
- ⭐ Create a structured project folder on Google Drive with subfolders: 00-TongQuan, 10-BanThietKe, 20-DanhSachYeuCau, 30-HuongDanAI, 40-KiemTra, 50-PhienBan.
- ⭐ Write a 10-line project introduction file ("GioiThieu.md") describing project name, start date, purpose, users, problems solved, success criteria, exclusions, and deadlines.
- ⭐ Define the three main roles in the project: You (Project Owner), AI Assistant (ChatGPT), and Builder (Claude Code).
- ⭐ Clarify your project scope and timeline: categorize as small (<1 week), medium (1-4 weeks), or large (>4 weeks) to decide documentation and process depth.
- ⭐ Initiate conversation with AI Assistant to clarify the project idea by answering 5 key questions: Who uses it? What problem is solved? When is it done? What is excluded? Deadline?

## Phase 2 – Design & Documentation
- ⭐ Receive and review the AI Assistant’s general design document; confirm or request revisions.
- ⭐ Break down the project into smaller parts; ask AI Assistant to create detailed design for the first part.
- ⭐ Approve detailed design and ask AI Assistant to generate a precise "commitment checklist" (Danh sách cam kết) specifying measurable requirements and forbidden actions.
- ⭐ Have AI Assistant prepare detailed instructions for Builder (Claude Code) including design documents, checklist, and step-by-step plan.
- ⭐ Send instructions to Builder and await a clear progress report following the provided report template.

## Phase 3 – Development & Iteration
- ⭐ Forward Builder’s progress report to AI Assistant for verification against the checklist.
- ⭐ If issues are found, get AI Assistant to write minimal fix instructions and send them back to Builder.
- ⭐ Repeat fix-report-check cycles up to 2-3 times until all checklist items are met.
- ⭐ Confirm completion of each part by issuing "XÁC NHẬN XONG" and request AI Assistant to record progress notes.
- ⭐ Regularly back up the project folder on Google Drive by making copies with date-stamped names.

## Phase 4 – Testing & Quality Assurance
- ⭐ Conduct manual tests of implemented features according to test cases defined in the checklist.
- ⭐ Record test sessions with screenshots or short videos and save them in the version folder.
- ⭐ Use AI Assistant to review Builder’s reports and test results for compliance with requirements.
- ⭐ Perform quality review focusing on security, performance, and maintainability using AI Assistant’s guidelines.
- ➕ Optionally, prepare a summary report of known issues and improvement suggestions.

## Phase 5 – Release & Maintenance
- ⭐ Prepare a one-page user guide for each version and save it in the version folder.
- ⭐ Write release notes documenting new features, fixes, known limitations, and next steps.
- ⭐ Share the release folder with stakeholders or users.
- ⭐ Plan next development phases based on feedback and project roadmap.
- ➕ Optionally, schedule regular reminders for progress recording and backups.

## Notes
- Always communicate clearly and specifically with AI Assistant; avoid vague answers.
- Use the three magic confirmation phrases consistently: "XÁC NHẬN LƯU", "XÁC NHẬN LÀM", "XÁC NHẬN XONG".
- Keep instructions to Builder minimal and focused to avoid scope creep.
- Maintain strict version control and naming conventions to prevent confusion.
- Be aware of AI limitations: short memory, variability in outputs, and inability to handle complex environment issues.
- Know when to escalate to human programmers (e.g., repeated errors, environment problems, tight deadlines).
