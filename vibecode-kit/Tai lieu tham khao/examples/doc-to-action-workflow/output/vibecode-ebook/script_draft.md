# Script Draft

## Hook (15–30 seconds)  
Have you ever had a great idea for an AI-powered project but felt stuck because you don’t know how to code? What if I told you there’s a simple, step-by-step way to turn your idea into a working AI product, even if you’re a non-coder or low-code user? Today, I want to introduce you to the Vibecode framework — a practical, human-friendly approach to managing AI projects without deep programming skills.

## Main Points (2–3 minutes)  

### Point 1 – The Three Key Roles in Your AI Project  
Think of your AI project like building a house. There are three main roles: You, the Homeowner; the Smart Assistant, who is like the Architect; and the Builder, who actually constructs the house.  

- **You (Homeowner)** decide what you want, approve designs, and say when it’s done or needs fixing.  
- **The Smart Assistant (Architect)** is your AI helper, like ChatGPT, who asks you the right questions, draws up clear plans, and checks the builder’s work.  
- **The Builder (Claude Code)** is the AI that writes the actual code based on the assistant’s instructions and reports back on progress.  

This clear division helps you stay in control without needing to code yourself.

### Point 2 – The Step-by-Step Workflow to Build Your First Version  
Vibecode breaks down your project into manageable steps you can follow in about 60 minutes to get your first version running:  

1. **Set up your project folder** with clear subfolders for overview, design, requirements, AI instructions, testing, and versions. This keeps everything organized and easy to find.  
2. **Write a simple 10-line project introduction** that answers: What is the project? Who uses it? What problem does it solve? When is success? What won’t you do? And when is the deadline?  
3. **Create your AI assistant in ChatGPT** with clear instructions to act as your architect — asking you five key questions to clarify your idea.  
4. **Have a conversation with your assistant** to refine your idea and get a one-page general design document.  
5. **Break down the design into smaller parts** and write detailed requirements — like a contract — that the builder must meet.  
6. **Get the assistant to write clear instructions for the builder** (Claude Code) to follow, including how to report progress.  
7. **Send instructions to the builder and receive progress reports.** You then pass these reports back to the assistant for quality checks.  
8. **Iterate until the part is done**, then record progress and back up your project.  

This workflow keeps you in the driver’s seat, ensures clarity, and leverages AI tools effectively.

### Point 3 – How AI Helps and Its Limits  
AI is great at asking the right questions, organizing your scattered ideas into clear documents, creating checklists, reminding you to save progress, and explaining technical terms in simple language.  

But AI has limits: it forgets long conversations, can create multiple versions causing confusion, and sometimes can’t solve complex technical errors or environment issues. That’s when you might need a real programmer.  

The Vibecode framework helps you manage these challenges by encouraging clear documentation, frequent backups, and precise instructions.

## Takeaway & Gentle Call-to-Action (30–60 seconds)  
So, if you have an AI project idea but feel overwhelmed by coding, try the Vibecode approach: start by defining your project clearly, set up your roles, and use AI as your assistant and builder in a structured workflow.  

Today, take 30 minutes to write a simple 10-line introduction to your idea and think about who your users are and what problem you want to solve. This small step will set you on the path to building your AI project confidently.
