## 1. HEADLINE FORMULAS

### The 4U Framework
Every headline should have at least 2 of these:
- **Useful** - Solves a problem
- **Urgent** - Creates time pressure
- **Unique** - Differentiates
- **Ultra-specific** - Concrete, not vague

### Proven Headline Structures

**Value Proposition:**
```
[Action] + [Outcome] + [Without Pain Point]

Examples:
- "Build landing pages in minutes without writing code"
- "Ship features 10x faster without sacrificing quality"
- "Scale your API without managing infrastructure"
```

**How-To:**
```
How to [Achieve Outcome] [Timeframe/Constraint]

Examples:
- "How to launch your SaaS in a weekend"
- "How top teams ship 3x faster with AI"
- "How to reduce churn by 40% in 30 days"
```

**Number/List:**
```
[Number] Ways to [Achieve Benefit]

Examples:
- "7 ways to double your conversion rate"
- "3 simple steps to automate your workflow"
- "The only 5 metrics that matter for growth"
```

**Question:**
```
[Pain Point Question]?

Examples:
- "Tired of slow deployments?"
- "Why do 80% of startups fail at scaling?"
- "What if you could code 10x faster?"
```

**Before/After:**
```
From [Pain State] to [Desired State]

Examples:
- "From idea to production in hours, not weeks"
- "From spreadsheets to real-time dashboards"
- "From manual testing to automated CI/CD"
```

## 2. SUBHEADLINE PATTERNS

### Expand on the Promise
```
Headline: Ship faster with AI-powered development
Subheadline: Claude Code writes, tests, and deploys your code while you focus on what matters.
```

### Add Social Proof
```
Headline: The API platform for modern teams
Subheadline: Join 50,000+ developers who've simplified their backend.
```

### Address Objections
```
Headline: Enterprise security, startup speed
Subheadline: SOC 2 compliant, GDPR ready—without the enterprise complexity.
```

### Specify the Audience
```
Headline: Design systems that scale
Subheadline: Built for design teams who ship products, not just mockups.
```

## 3. CALL-TO-ACTION (CTA) COPY

### Primary CTA Formulas
```
[Action Verb] + [Benefit/Result]

Strong:
✓ "Start building free"
✓ "Get instant access"
✓ "Launch your first project"
✓ "See it in action"
✓ "Claim your free trial"

Weak:
✗ "Submit"
✗ "Click here"
✗ "Learn more"
✗ "Sign up"
✗ "Get started" (overused)
```

### Secondary CTA (Lower Commitment)
```
✓ "Watch 2-min demo"
✓ "See pricing"
✓ "View examples"
✓ "Book a call"
✓ "Read the docs"
```

### CTA Button Copy Rules
1. **Use first person** - "Start my free trial" > "Start your free trial"
2. **Add urgency** - "Get early access" > "Sign up"
3. **Reduce risk** - "Try free for 14 days" > "Start trial"
4. **Be specific** - "Download the template" > "Download now"

## 4. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS

### Feature → Benefit → Outcome
```
Feature: Real-time collaboration
Benefit: Work together without merge conflicts
Outcome: Ship features 2x faster as a team

Copy: "Real-time collaboration means no more merge conflicts. Ship features 2x faster as a team."
```

### Feature Card Format
```
[Icon]
[Feature Name] (2-4 words)
[One-line benefit] (8-12 words)

Example:
🔒
End-to-end encryption
Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Always.
```

### Avoid Feature Soup
```
Bad: "Multi-tenant architecture, SSO, RBAC, audit logs, webhooks"
Good: "Enterprise-ready security with SSO, role-based access, and full audit trails"
```

---

## 5. SOCIAL PROOF COPY

### Testimonial Structure
```
"[Specific result/outcome] [Context of how]. [Emotional benefit]."
— Name, Title at Company

Example:
"We cut our deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes. The team actually looks forward to releases now."
— Sarah Chen, VP Engineering at Acme
```

### Metrics That Convert
```
Strong:
✓ "Reduced build times by 73%"
✓ "10,000+ production deployments daily"
✓ "4.9/5 rating from 2,500+ reviews"

Weak:
✗ "Many satisfied customers"
✗ "Industry-leading performance"
✗ "Trusted by companies worldwide"
```

### Logo Bar Copy
```
"Trusted by engineering teams at"
"Powering products at"
"Used by teams at"
"Built for teams like"
```

## 6. MICROCOPY

### Form Labels & Placeholders
```
Label: Work email
Placeholder: you@company.com
Helper: We'll never share your email

Label: Password
Placeholder: At least 8 characters
Helper: Use letters, numbers, and symbols
```

### Empty States
```
[Illustration]
"No projects yet"
"Create your first project to get started. It only takes 30 seconds."
[CTA: Create project]
```

### Error Messages
```
Bad: "Error 500: Internal server error"
Good: "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it. Try again in a few minutes."

Bad: "Invalid input"
Good: "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., you@example.com)"
```

### Success Messages
```
✓ "You're in! Check your email for next steps."
✓ "Project created successfully. Let's add your first feature."
✓ "Changes saved. Your team can see updates in real-time."
```

### Loading States
```
Short operations: [spinner only]
Medium (2-5s): "Loading your dashboard..."
Long (5s+): "This might take a moment. We're crunching the numbers..."
```

### Landing Pages

- Feature lists: ✓ checkmarks, specific limits

### Dashboards

### Documentation

- Intro: What user will learn/achieve

## 8. COPY CHECKLIST

### Before Writing
- [ ] Who is the audience? (Role, pain points)
- [ ] What's the one thing they should do?
- [ ] What objections might they have?

- [ ] Is the benefit clear in first 5 words?
- [ ] Would the reader say "that's me"?

### Words to Avoid

```

### Power Words
```
Verbs: Launch, Build, Ship, Create, Transform, Unlock, Boost
Results: Instantly, Automatically, Effortlessly, Finally
Proof: Proven, Guaranteed, Trusted, Verified
